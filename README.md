# README for Running `llama2.sh`

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive instructions on how to execute the `llama2.sh` script. The `llama2.sh` script is designed to facilitate the execution of a Python-based application. The instructions herein are intended to ensure that users can seamlessly run the script in a manner that is both efficient and effective.

## Prerequisites

Before running the `llama2.sh` script, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Operating System**: The script is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux or macOS.
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.6 or higher must be installed on your system. You can verify your Python version by running:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. These dependencies are typically listed in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Script Overview

The `llama2.sh` script is a shell script that automates the execution of a Python application. It sets up the necessary environment variables and invokes the Python interpreter with the appropriate arguments.

## Instructions for Running `llama2.sh`

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository containing the `llama2.sh` script to your local machine. Use the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/llama2.git
cd llama2
```

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Ensure that the `llama2.sh` script has executable permissions. You can modify the permissions using the `chmod` command:
```sh
chmod +x llama2.sh
```

### Step 3: Execute the Script

Run the `llama2.sh` script using the following command:
```sh
./llama2.sh
```

### Step 4: Monitor the Output

The script will execute the Python application and display output in the terminal. Monitor the output for any errors or important information.

## Detailed Explanation of `llama2.sh`

Below is a detailed breakdown of the `llama2.sh` script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set environment variables
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

# Activate virtual environment if exists
if [ -d "venv" ]; then
    source venv/bin/activate
fi

# Execute the Python script
python3 main.py "$@"
```

### Script Components

1. **Shebang**: The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
2. **Environment Variables**: The `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` command sets the `PYTHONPATH` to the current working directory, ensuring that Python can locate the necessary modules.
3. **Virtual Environment Activation**: If a virtual environment (`venv`) exists, it is activated using `source venv/bin/activate`. This ensures that the script runs in an isolated environment with the correct dependencies.
4. **Python Script Execution**: The `python3 main.py "$@"` command runs the `main.py` Python script, passing any additional arguments provided to `llama2.sh`.
